# DLSGAN

Official implementation of DLSGAN  
  
Environment: Windows 11 WSL, Tensorflow 2.15.0.post1
The codes for experiments of ICPRAM version are available at "https://github.com/jeongik-jo/DLSGAN-old"

To train the model:
1. Download FFHQ images from https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset
2. Put images into './dataset/ffhq/train' and './dataset/ffhq/test'.
3. Set Hyperparameters.py, then run Main.py

Algorithm for DLSGAN is in "Train.py"
